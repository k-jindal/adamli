# First Year (August 2015- May 2016)
## Rotation 1 (08/15 - 11/15) Sarma:
During this time period, I used MATLAB and Python to analyze epilepsy Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) data. Each patient had the varying channel data condensed into a network. All channels formed a weighted undirected graph between all other channels, with a coherence, or power similarity measure as the weighted edge between vertices. This graph was formed at an averaged time window over the entire time series with an overlap of a certain percentage. 

Once the time series graph was formed, every graph produced an eigenvector centrality measure, which measures how important certain vertices are in the graph. From here, various data mining analyses were done to look for a notion of a pre-ictal state. The following analyses were carried out.
